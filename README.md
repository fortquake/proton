/TL:DR If you can run Minecraft, you can run this

[Installation Process]

Go to https://www.python.org/downloads/ and install Python for your OS
Open Powershell, and use pip to install all required modules.
Run the file to ensure there are no errors.
If the program 'takes over your computer', ensure your curser is outside the python shell, and spam the close client key (default 'p')

[Running Advice]

Run outside of game first, then check for error messages, eg missing module
If modules don't disable, try shorter keypresses, as it may register the keypress twice.

[Error Advice]

The program should be free of errors, however if one does occur, please report this to the dev, along with the error code.

[Customisation advice]
Edit the keybinds.txt document to change your keybinds
Do not edit it except for changing the first character of each line. Do not remove any spaces.
