Proton
Minecraft Hack Client
Version 1.2.1

[System Requirements]
Python 3.9 or later installed
Python Modules - keyboard, pyautogui, tkinter, threading, webbrowser, time, random
/TL:DR If you can run Minecraft, you can run this.

[Installation Process]
Go to https://www.python.org/downloads/ and install Python for your OS.
Open Powershell, and use pip to install all required modules (or use the included file that will attempt to install them for you).
Run the file to ensure there are no errors.
If the program 'takes over your computer', ensure your curser is outside the python shell, and hold down the close client key (default 'p').

[Running Advice]
Run outside of game first, then check for error messages, eg missing module.

[Customisation advice]
Edit keybinds.txt to change your keybinds.
Do not edit it except for changing the first character of each line. Do not remove any spaces.
