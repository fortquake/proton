Proton
Minecraft Keypressing Utility v1.2.2

## System Requirements
At least 4 threads
Python 3.9 or later
Python Modules - keyboard, pyautogui, tkinter, threading, webbrowser, time, random

## Installation Process
Go to https://www.python.org/downloads/ and install Python.
Run the included 'installer.py' file which will install modules required for Proton to run.
Run Proton to ensure there are no errors.
If the program 'takes over your computer', ensure your curser is outside the python shell, and hold down the close client key (default 'p').

## Running Advice
Run outside of game first, checking for errors, for example a missing module.
Check the logs.txt and errorCodes.txt files for details about errors.

## Customisation Advice
Edit keybinds.txt to change your keybinds. When editing, only change the first section before the dash. Don't remove any spaces.
